In a perspective projection, shapes that are further from the camera appear smaller than shapes that are near the camera. This technique, called foreshortening, creates realistic 3D scenes. It’s applied by default in WebGL mode. `perspective()` changes the camera’s perspective by changing its viewing frustum. The frustum is the volume of space that’s visible to the camera. Its shape is a pyramid with its top cut off. The camera is placed where the top of the pyramid should be and views everything between the frustum’s top (near) plane and its bottom (far) plane. The first parameter, `fovy`, is the camera’s vertical field of view. It’s an angle that describes how tall or narrow a view the camera has. For example, calling `perspective(0.5)` sets the camera’s vertical field of view to 0.5 radians. By default, `fovy` is calculated based on the sketch’s height and the camera’s default z-coordinate, which is 800. The formula for the default `fovy` is `2 * atan(height / 2 / 800)`. The second parameter, `aspect`, is the camera’s aspect ratio. It’s a number that describes the ratio of the top plane’s width to its height. For example, calling `perspective(0.5, 1.5)` sets the camera’s field of view to 0.5 radians and aspect ratio to 1.5, which would make shapes appear thinner on a square canvas. By default, aspect is set to `width / height`. The third parameter, `near`, is the distance from the camera to the near plane. For example, calling `perspective(0.5, 1.5, 100)` sets the camera’s field of view to 0.5 radians, its aspect ratio to 1.5, and places the near plane 100 pixels from the camera.

    "description": "A template for creating objects of a particular type. Classes can make it easier to program with objects. For example, a `Frog` class could create objects that behave like frogs. Each object created using a class is called an instance of that class. All instances of a class are the same type. Here's an example of creating an instance of a `Frog` class: let fifi = new Frog(50, 50, 20); ` The variable `fifi` refers to an instance of the `Frog` class. The keyword `new` is used to call the `Frog` class' constructor in the statement `new Frog()`. Altogether, a new `Frog` object was created and assigned to the variable `fifi`. Classes are templates, so they can be used to create more than one instance: // First Frog instance. let frog1 = new Frog(25, 50, 10); // Second Frog instance. let frog2 = new Frog(75, 50, 10); ` A simple `Frog` class could be declared as follows: class Frog { constructor(x, y, size) { // This code runs once when an instance is created. this.x = x; this.y = y; this.size = size; } show() { // This code runs once when myFrog.show() is called. textAlign(CENTER, CENTER); textSize(this.size); text('🐸', this.x, this.y); } hop() { // This code runs once when myFrog.hop() is called. this.x += random(-10, 10); this.y += random(-10, 10); } } ` Class declarations begin with the keyword `class` followed by the class name, such as `Frog`, and curly braces `{}`. Class names should use `PascalCase` and can't have spaces in their names. For example, naming a class `Kermit The Frog` with spaces between each word would throw a `SyntaxError`. The code between the curly braces `{}` defines the class. Functions that belong to a class are called methods. `constructor()`, `show()`, and `hop()` are methods in the `Frog` class. Methods define an object's behavior. Methods can accept parameters and return values, just like functions. Note that methods don't use the `function` keyword. `constructor()` is a special method that's called once when an instance of the class is created. The statement `new Frog()` calls the `Frog` class' `constructor()` method. A class definition is a template for instances. The keyword `this` refers to an instance's data and methods. For example, each `Frog` instance has unique coordinates stored in `this.x` and `this.y`. The `show()` method uses those coordinates to draw the frog. The `hop()` method updates those coordinates when called. Once a `Frog` instance is created, its data and methods can be accessed using the dot operator `.` as follows: // Draw a lily pad. fill('green'); stroke('green'); circle(fifi.x, fifi.y, 2 * fifi.size); // Show the Frog. fifi.show(); // Hop. fifi.hop(); `",

The `scale()` function can shrink or stretch the coordinate system so that shapes appear at different sizes. There are two ways to call `scale()` with parameters that set the scale factor(s). The first way to call `scale()` uses numbers to set the amount of scaling. The first parameter, `s`, sets the amount to scale each axis. For example, calling `scale(2)` stretches the x-, y-, and z-axes by a factor of 2. The next two parameters, `y` and `z`, are optional. They set the amount to scale the y- and z-axes. For example, calling `scale(2, 0.5, 1)` stretches the x-axis by a factor of 2, shrinks the y-axis by a factor of 0.5, and leaves the z-axis unchanged. The second way to call `scale()` uses a p5.Vector object to set the scale factors. For example, calling `scale(myVector)` uses the x-, y-, and z-components of `myVector` to set the amount of scaling along the x-, y-, and z-axes. Doing so is the same as calling `scale(myVector.x, myVector.y, myVector.z)`. By default, transformations accumulate. For example, calling `scale(1)` twice has the same effect as calling `scale(2)` once. The push() and pop() functions can be used to isolate transformations within distinct drawing groups. Note: Transformations are reset at the beginning of the draw loop. Calling `scale(2)` inside the draw() function won't cause shapes to grow continuously.",

See textAlign() for more ways to align text. The fourth parameter, `fontSize`, is optional. It sets the text's font size. By default, `font.textToPoints()` will use the current textSize(). The fifth parameter, `options`, is also optional. `font.textToPoints()` expects an object with the following properties: `sampleFactor` is the ratio of the text's path length to the number of samples. It defaults to 0.1. Higher values produce more points along the path and are more precise. `simplifyThreshold` removes collinear points if it's set to a number other than 0. The value represents the threshold angle to use when determining whether two edges are collinear.",

Default is to always match the main canvas height. `density`: pixel density of the p5.Framebuffer object. Default is to always match the main canvas pixel density. `textureFiltering`: how to read values from the p5.Framebuffer object. Either `LINEAR` (nearby pixels will be interpolated) or `NEAREST` (no interpolation). Generally, use `LINEAR` when using the texture as an image and `NEAREST` if reading the texture as data. Default is `LINEAR`. If the `width`, `height`, or `density` attributes are set, they won't automatically match the main canvas and must be changed manually.

This process is commonly used in sound production and recording to change the waveform before it reaches a sound output device. EQ can also be used as an audio effect to create interesting distortions by filtering out parts of the spectrum. p5.EQ is built using a chain of Web Audio Biquad Filter Nodes and can be instantiated with 3 or 8 bands. Bands can be added or removed from the EQ by directly modifying p5.EQ.bands (the array that stores filters). This class extends p5.Effect.

Each value represents amplitude of the waveform at that sample of time. • `FFT.analyze() ` computes amplitude values along the frequency domain. The array indices correspond to frequencies (i.e. pitches), from the lowest to the highest that humans can hear. Each value represents amplitude at that slice of the frequency spectrum. Use with `getEnergy()` to measure amplitude at specific frequencies, or within a range of frequencies. FFT analyzes a very short snapshot of sound called a sample buffer. It returns an array of amplitude measurements, referred to as `bins`. The array is 1024 bins long by default. You can change the bin array length, but it must be a power of 2 between 16 and 1024 in order for the FFT algorithm to function correctly. The actual size of the FFT buffer is twice the number of bins, so given a standard sample rate, the buffer is 2048/44100 seconds long.",

See Wikipedia and MDN for more details about transformations. There are two ways to call `applyMatrix()` in two and three dimensions.

The push() and pop() functions can be used to isolate transformations within distinct drawing groups. Note: Transformations are reset at the beginning of the draw loop.

The final color results from blending the source pixel's color with the canvas pixel's color. RGB color values from the source and canvas pixels are compared, added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided to create different effects. Red values with red values, greens with greens, and blues with blues. The parameter, `mode`, sets the blend mode. For example, calling `blendMode(ADD)` sets the blend mode to `ADD`. The following blend modes are available in both 2D and WebGL mode: `BLEND`: color values from the source overwrite the canvas. This is the default mode. `ADD`: color values from the source are added to values from the canvas. `DARKEST`: keeps the darkest color value. `LIGHTEST`: keeps the lightest color value. `EXCLUSION`: similar to `DIFFERENCE` but with less contrast. `MULTIPLY`: color values from the source are multiplied with values from the canvas. The result is always darker. `SCREEN`: all color values are inverted, then multiplied, then inverted again. The result is always lighter. (Opposite of `MULTIPLY`) `REPLACE`: the last source drawn completely replaces the rest of the canvas. `REMOVE`: overlapping pixels are removed by making them completely transparent. The following blend modes are only available in 2D mode: `DIFFERENCE`: color values from the source are subtracted from the values from the canvas. If the difference is a negative number, it's made positive. `OVERLAY`: combines `MULTIPLY` and `SCREEN`. Dark values in the canvas get darker and light values get lighter. `HARD_LIGHT`: combines `MULTIPLY` and `SCREEN`. Dark values in the source get darker and light values get lighter. `SOFT_LIGHT`: a softer version of `HARD_LIGHT`. `DODGE`: lightens light tones and increases contrast. Divides the canvas color values by the inverted color values from the source. `BURN`: darkens dark tones and increases contrast. Divides the source color values by the inverted color values from the canvas, then inverts the result.

  "WEBGL": {
    "description": "One of the two render modes in p5.js, used for computationally intensive tasks like 3D rendering and shaders. `WEBGL` differs from the default `P2D` renderer in the following ways: Coordinate System - When drawing in `WEBGL` mode, the origin point (0,0,0) is located at the center of the screen, not the top-left corner. See the tutorial page about coordinates and transformations. 3D Shapes - `WEBGL` mode can be used to draw 3-dimensional shapes like box(), sphere(), cone(), and more. See the tutorial page about custom geometry to make more complex objects. Shape Detail - When drawing in `WEBGL` mode, you can specify how smooth curves should be drawn by using a `detail` parameter. See the wiki section about shapes for a more information and an example. Textures - A texture is like a skin that wraps onto a shape. See the wiki section about textures for examples of mapping images onto surfaces with textures. Materials and Lighting - `WEBGL` offers different types of lights like ambientLight() to place around a scene. Materials like specularMaterial() reflect the lighting to convey shape and depth. See the tutorial page for styling and appearance to experiment with different combinations. Camera - The viewport of a `WEBGL` sketch can be adjusted by changing camera attributes. See the tutorial page section about cameras for an explanation of camera controls. Text - `WEBGL` requires opentype/truetype font files to be preloaded using loadFont(). See the wiki section about text for details, along with a workaround. Shaders - Shaders are hardware accelerated programs that can be used for a variety of effects and graphics. See the introduction to shaders to get started with shaders in p5.js.

Once the p5.Shader object is created, it can be used with the shader() function, as in `shader(myShader)`. A shader program consists of two parts, a vertex shader and a fragment shader. The vertex shader affects where 3D geometry is drawn on the screen and the fragment shader affects color. The first parameter, `vertSrc`, sets the vertex shader.

It’s a string that contains the fragment shader program written in GLSL. A shader can optionally describe hooks, which are functions in GLSL that users may choose to provide to customize the behavior of the shader using the `modify()` method of `p5.Shader`. These are added by describing the hooks in a third parameter, `options`, and referencing the hooks in your `vertSrc` or `fragSrc`. Hooks for the vertex or fragment shader are described under the `vertex` and `fragment` keys of `options`. Each one is an object. where each key is the type and name of a hook function, and each value is a string with the parameter list and default implementation of the hook. For example, to let users optionally run code at the start of the vertex shader, the options object could include: { vertex: { 'void beforeVertex': '() {}' } } ` Then, in your vertex shader source, you can run a hook by calling a function with the same name prefixed by `HOOK_`. If you want to check if the default hook has been replaced, maybe to avoid extra overhead, you can check if the same name prefixed by `AUGMENTED_HOOK_` has been defined: void main() { // In most cases, just calling the hook is fine: HOOK_beforeVertex(); // Alternatively, for more efficiency: #ifdef AUGMENTED_HOOK_beforeVertex HOOK_beforeVertex(); #endif // Add the rest of your shader code here! } ` Note: Only filter shaders can be used in 2D mode. All shaders can be used in WebGL mode.",

For example, calling `createVector(3, 4)` creates a new p5.Vector object with an x-component of 3 and a y-component of 4. From the origin, this vector's tip is 3 units to the right and 4 units down. p5.Vector objects are often used to program motion because they simplify the math. For example, a moving ball has a position and a velocity. Position describes where the ball is in space. The ball's position vector extends from the origin to the ball's center. Velocity describes the ball's speed and the direction it's moving. If the ball is moving straight up, its velocity vector points straight up.

Calling `debugMode()` displays the grid and axes icon with their default size and position. There are four ways to call `debugMode()` with optional parameters to customize the debugging environment. The first way to call `debugMode()` has one parameter, `mode`. If the system constant `GRID` is passed, as in `debugMode(GRID)`, then the grid will be displayed and the axes icon will be hidden. If the constant `AXES` is passed, as in `debugMode(AXES)`, then the axes icon will be displayed and the grid will be hidden. The second way to call `debugMode()` has six parameters. The first parameter, `mode`, selects either `GRID` or `AXES` to be displayed. The next five parameters, `gridSize`, `gridDivisions`, `xOff`, `yOff`, and `zOff` are optional. They’re numbers that set the appearance of the grid (`gridSize` and `gridDivisions`) and the placement of the axes icon (`xOff`, `yOff`, and `zOff`). For example, calling `debugMode(20, 5, 10, 10, 10)` sets the `gridSize` to 20 pixels, the number of `gridDivisions` to 5, and offsets the axes icon by 10 pixels along the x-, y-, and z-axes.

For example, a `for` loop makes it easy to express the idea \"draw five lines\" like so: for (let x = 10; x The loop's header begins with the keyword `for`. Loops generally count up or count down as they repeat, or iterate. The statements in parentheses `let x = 10; x `let x = 10` tells the loop to start counting at `10` and keep track of iterations using the variable `x`. `x `x += 20` tells the loop to count up by `20` at the end of each iteration. The code between the curly braces `{}` is the loop's body. Statements in the loop body are repeated during each iteration of the loop. It's common to create infinite loops accidentally. When this happens, sketches may become unresponsive and the web browser may display a warning. For example, the following loop never stops iterating because it doesn't count up: for (let x = 10; x The statement `x = 20` keeps the variable `x` stuck at `20`, which is always less than `100`. `for` loops can also count down: for (let d = 100; d > 0; d -= 10) { circle(50, 50, d); } ` `for` loops can also contain other loops. The following nested loop draws a grid of points: // Loop from left to right. for (let x = 10; x `for` loops are also helpful for iterating through the elements of an array. For example, it's common to iterate through an array that contains information about where or what to draw: // Create an array of x-coordinates. let xCoordinates = [20, 40, 60]; for (let i = 0; i If the array's values aren't modified, the `for...of` statement can simplify the code. They're similar to `for` loops in Python and `for-each` loops in C++ and Java. The following loops have the same effect: // Draw circles with a for loop. let xCoordinates = [20, 40, 60]; for (let i = 0; i // Draw circles with a for...of statement. let xCoordinates = [20, 40, 60]; for (let x of xCoordinates) { circle(x, 50, 20); } ` In the code snippets above, the variables `i` and `x` have different roles. In the first snippet, `i` counts from `0` up to `2`, which is one less than `xCoordinates.length`. `i` is used to access the element in `xCoordinates` at index `i`. In the second code snippet, `x` isn't keeping track of the loop's progress or an index. During each iteration, `x` contains the next element of `xCoordinates`. `x` starts from the beginning of `xCoordinates` (`20`) and updates its value to `40` and then `60` during the next iterations.",

For example, an `if` statement makes it easy to express the idea \"Draw a circle if the mouse is pressed.\": if (mouseIsPressed === true) { circle(mouseX, mouseY, 20); } ` The statement header begins with the keyword `if`. The expression in parentheses `mouseIsPressed === true` is a `Boolean` expression that's either `true` or `false`. The code between the curly braces `{}` is the if statement's body. The body only runs if the `Boolean` expression is `true`. The mouseIsPressed system variable is always `true` or `false`, so the code snippet above could also be written as follows: if (mouseIsPressed) { circle(mouseX, mouseY, 20); } ` An `if`-`else` statement adds a block of code that runs if the `Boolean` expression is `false`. For example, here's an `if`-`else` statement that expresses the idea \"Draw a circle if the mouse is pressed. Otherwise, display a message.\": if (mouseIsPressed === true) { // When true. circle(mouseX, mouseY, 20); } else { // When false. text('Click me!', 50, 50); } ` There are two possible paths, or branches, in this code snippet. The program must follow one branch or the other. An `else`-`if` statement makes it possible to add more branches. `else`-`if` statements run different blocks of code under different conditions. For example, an `else`-`if` statement makes it easy to express the idea \"If the mouse is on the left, paint the canvas white. If the mouse is in the middle, paint the canvas gray. Otherwise, paint the canvas black.\": if (mouseX `if` statements can add as many `else`-`if` statements as needed. However, there can only be one `else` statement and it must be last. `if` statements can also check for multiple conditions at once. For example, the `Boolean` operator `&&` (AND) checks whether two expressions are both `true`: if (keyIsPressed === true && key === 'p') { text('You pressed the \"p\" key!', 50, 50); } ` If the user is pressing a key AND that key is `'p'`, then a message will display. The `Boolean` operator `||` (OR) checks whether at least one of two expressions is `true`: if (keyIsPressed === true || mouseIsPressed === true) { text('You did something!', 50, 50); } ` If the user presses a key, or presses a mouse button, or both, then a message will display. The body of an `if` statement can contain another `if` statement. This is called a \"nested `if` statement.\" For example, nested `if` statements make it easy to express the idea \"If a key is pressed, then check if the key is `'r'`. If it is, then set the fill to red.\": if (keyIsPressed === true) { if (key === 'r') { fill('red'); } } ` See Boolean and Number to learn more about these data types and the operations they support.",

URLs such as `'https://example.com/model.obj'` may be blocked due to browser security. Note: When loading a `.obj` file that references materials stored in `.mtl` files, p5.js will attempt to load and apply those materials. To ensure that the `.obj` file reads the `.mtl` file correctly include the `.mtl` file alongside it. The first way to call `loadModel()` has three optional parameters after the file path. The first optional parameter, `successCallback`, is a function to call once the model loads. For example, `loadModel('/assets/model.obj', handleModel)` will call the `handleModel()` function once the model loads. The second optional parameter, `failureCallback`, is a function to call if the model fails to load. For example, `loadModel('/assets/model.obj', handleModel, handleFailure)` will call the `handleFailure()` function if an error occurs while loading. The third optional parameter, `fileType`, is the model’s file extension as a string. For example, `loadModel('/assets/model', handleModel, handleFailure, '.obj')` will try to load the file model as a `.obj` file. The second way to call `loadModel()` has four optional parameters after the file path. The first optional parameter is a `Boolean` value. If `true` is passed, as in `loadModel('/assets/model.obj', true)`, then the model will be resized to ensure it fits the canvas. The next three parameters are `successCallback`, `failureCallback`, and `fileType` as described above. The third way to call `loadModel()` has one optional parameter after the file path. The optional parameter, `options`, is an `Object` with options, as in `loadModel('/assets/model.obj', options)`. The `options` object can have the following properties: let options = { // Enables standardized size scaling during loading if set to true. normalize: true, // Function to call once the model loads. successCallback: handleModel, // Function to call if an error occurs while loading. failureCallback: handleError, // Model's file extension. fileType: '.stl', // Flips the U texture coordinates of the model. flipU: false, // Flips the V texture coordinates of the model. flipV: false }; // Pass the options object to loadModel(). loadModel('/assets/model.obj', options); ` Models can take time to load.

The first way is to scale the inputs. `noise()` interprets inputs as coordinates. The sequence of noise values will be smoother when the input coordinates are closer. The second way is to use the noiseDetail() function. The version of `noise()` with one parameter computes noise values in one dimension. This dimension can be thought of as space, as in `noise(x)`, or time, as in `noise(t)`. The version of `noise()` with two parameters computes noise values in two dimensions.

Position describes where the ball is in space. The ball's position vector extends from the origin to the ball's center. Velocity describes the ball's speed and the direction it's moving. If the ball is moving straight up, its velocity vector points straight up. Adding the ball's velocity vector to its position vector moves it, as in `pos.add(vel)`.

The randomSeed() function can be used to generate the same sequence of numbers or choices each time a sketch runs. The version of `random()` with no parameters returns a random number from 0 up to but not including 1. The version of `random()` with one parameter works one of two ways. If the argument passed is a number, `random()` returns a random number from 0 up to but not including the number. For example, calling `random(5)` returns values between 0 and 5. If the argument passed is an array, `random()` returns a random element from that array. For example, calling `random(['🦁', '🐯', '🐻'])` returns either a lion, tiger, or bear emoji. The version of `random()` with two parameters returns a random number from a given range. The arguments passed set the range's lower and upper bounds. For example, calling `random(-5, 10.2)` returns values from -5 up to but not including 10.2.",

In order for texture() to work, a shape needs a way to map the points on its surface to the pixels in an image. Built-in shapes such as rect() and box() already have these texture mappings based on their vertices. Custom shapes created with vertex() require texture mappings to be passed as uv coordinates. Each call to vertex() must include 5 arguments, as in `vertex(x, y, z, u, v)`, to map the vertex at coordinates `(x, y, z)` to the pixel at coordinates `(u, v)` within an image. For example, the corners of a rectangular image are mapped to the corners of a rectangle by default: ` // Apply the image as a texture. texture(img); // Draw the rectangle. rect(0, 0, 30, 50); ` If the image in the code snippet above has dimensions of 300 x 500 pixels, the same result could be achieved as follows: ` // Apply the image as a texture. texture(img); // Draw the rectangle. beginShape(); // Top-left. // u: 0, v: 0 vertex(0, 0, 0, 0, 0); // Top-right. // u: 300, v: 0 vertex(30, 0, 0, 300, 0); // Bottom-right. // u: 300, v: 500 vertex(30, 50, 0, 300, 500); // Bottom-left. // u: 0, v: 500 vertex(0, 50, 0, 0, 500); endShape(); ` `textureMode()` changes the coordinate system for uv coordinates. The parameter, `mode`, accepts two possible constants. If `NORMAL` is passed, as in `textureMode(NORMAL)`, then the texture’s uv coordinates can be provided in the range 0 to 1 instead of the image’s dimensions. This can be helpful for using the same code for multiple images of different sizes. For example, the code snippet above could be rewritten as follows: ` // Set the texture mode to use normalized coordinates. textureMode(NORMAL); // Apply the image as a texture. texture(img); // Draw the rectangle. beginShape(); // Top-left. // u: 0, v: 0 vertex(0, 0, 0, 0, 0); // Top-right. // u: 1, v: 0 vertex(30, 0, 0, 1, 0); // Bottom-right. // u: 1, v: 1 vertex(30, 50, 0, 1, 1); // Bottom-left. // u: 0, v: 1 vertex(0, 50, 0, 0, 1); endShape(); ` By default, `mode` is `IMAGE`, which scales uv coordinates to the dimensions of the image.

The second parameter, `wrapY`, is optional. It accepts the same three constants, `CLAMP`, `REPEAT`, and `MIRROR`.

The `translate()` function shifts the origin to a different position. Everything drawn after `translate()` is called will appear to be shifted. There are two ways to call `translate()` with parameters that set the origin's position. The first way to call `translate()` uses numbers to set the amount of translation. The first two parameters, `x` and `y`, set the amount to translate along the positive x- and y-axes. For example, calling `translate(20, 30)` translates the origin 20 pixels along the x-axis and 30 pixels along the y-axis. The third parameter, `z`, is optional. It sets the amount to translate along the positive z-axis. For example, calling `translate(20, 30, 40)` translates the origin 20 pixels along the x-axis, 30 pixels along the y-axis, and 40 pixels along the z-axis. The second way to call `translate()` uses a p5.Vector object to set the amount of translation. For example, calling `translate(myVector)` uses the x-, y-, and z-components of `myVector` to set the amount to translate along the x-, y-, and z-axes. Doing so is the same as calling `translate(myVector.x, myVector.y, myVector.z)`. By default, transformations accumulate. For example, calling `translate(10, 0)` twice has the same effect as calling `translate(20, 0)` once. The push() and pop() functions can be used to isolate transformations within distinct drawing groups. Note: Transformations are reset at the beginning of the draw loop. Calling `translate(10, 0)` inside the draw() function won't cause shapes to move continuously.",

The `===` operator (EQUAL) checks whether two values are equal. If they are, the expression evaluates to `true`. Otherwise, it evaluates to `false`. Note: There's also a `==` operator with two `=` instead of three. Don't use it. The mouseIsPressed system variable is always `true` or `false`, so the code snippet above could also be written as follows: if (mouseIsPressed) { circle(mouseX, mouseY, 20); } ` The `!==` operator (NOT EQUAL) checks whether two values are not equal, as in the following example: if (2 + 2 !== 4) { text('War is peace.', 50, 50); } ` Starting from the left, the arithmetic expression `2 + 2` produces the value `4`. The `Boolean` expression `4 !== 4` evaluates to `false` because `4` is equal to itself. As a result, the `if` statement's body is skipped. Note: There's also a `!=` operator with one `=` instead of two. Don't use it.

For example, it's common to use arithmetic operators with p5.js' system variables that are numbers: // Draw a circle at the center. circle(width / 2, height / 2, 20); ` // Draw a circle that moves from left to right. circle(frameCount * 0.01, 50, 20); ` Here's a quick overview of the arithmetic operators: 1 + 2 // Add 1 - 2 // Subtract 1 * 2 // Multiply 1 / 2 // Divide 1 % 2 // Remainder 1 ** 2 // Exponentiate ` It's common to update a number variable using arithmetic. For example, an object's location can be updated like so: x = x + 1; ` The statement above adds 1 to a variable `x` using the `+` operator. The addition assignment operator `+=` expresses the same idea: x += 1; ` Here's a quick overview of the assignment operators: x += 2 // Addition assignment x -= 2 // Subtraction assignment x *= 2 // Multiplication assignment x /= 2 // Division assignment x %= 2 // Remainder assignment ` Numbers can be compared using the relational operators `>`, `, `>=`, `, `===`, and `!==`.
